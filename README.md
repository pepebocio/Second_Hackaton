## Second Hackaton
This web page was created for the second hackathon about Tone.js as part of the course Advanced Coding: Tools and Methodologies of the MSc in Music and Acoustic Engineering.

## Versions
1. Uploaded on the day of the hackaton: Uploaded on the day of the hackathon: Consisted only of 5 tracks, without the implementation of the play song button or the low-pass filter.
2. Uploaded during the second class: While presenting to classmates, the bass track and the low-pass filter were implemented. The automation was partially working.
3. Current version: Focused on fixing bugs and arranging the song that plays when the button is pressed. For now, you can only play the song once due to fundamental issues with the way automation was programmed. This could be addressed in a future version, but I felt it was too much effort for a small hackathon. To avoid bugs, the buttons are blocked when necessary.
